This is a revamped and rewritten camera tool for the Yakuza 0 game. It works in Cutscenes and freeroam.

## Compilation
Yakuza Zero:

```
cargo +nightly build --release
```

Yakuza Kiwami:

```
cargo +nightly build --features kiwami --release
```

Yakuza Kiwami 2:

```
cargo +nightly build --features kiwami2 --release
```


## Usage

The relevant game must be running before you run the free camera tool.

You should see a Command Prompt window with instructions. If one briefly flashes on the screen, or doesn't appear at all, you may need to open Command Prompt yourself and run it to see what went wrong.
